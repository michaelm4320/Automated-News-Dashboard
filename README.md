# Notes for learning API's, Server/Cliend Side

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are interfaces that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. They define a set of rules and protocols that enable data exchange between systems.
Types of APIs:

RESTful APIs: These are APIs that follow the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) and use HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.
Using APIs in Web Development:

Client-Side Requests: Tools like Fetch API in JavaScript (for web browsers) or OkHttp in Java (for Android apps) are used to make HTTP requests from client-side applications to server-side APIs.
Server-Side Handling: APIs created using frameworks like Express (Node.js) or Spring Boot (Java) on the server side receive these requests, process them, and send back the appropriate responses.
RESTful API Creation: Express.js (for Node.js) and Spring Boot (for Java) are commonly used to create RESTful APIs that handle client requests and interact with databases or external services as needed.
